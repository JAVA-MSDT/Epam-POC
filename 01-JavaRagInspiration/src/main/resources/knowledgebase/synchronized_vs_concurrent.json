  "description": "For thread safety, prefer java.util.concurrent collections over synchronized wrapper methods for better scalability, performance, and maintainability. Concurrent collections use more sophisticated locking mechanisms.",
  "example": "Instead of: List<String> list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>()); Use: CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>(); Or: ConcurrentHashMap instead of Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>())",
