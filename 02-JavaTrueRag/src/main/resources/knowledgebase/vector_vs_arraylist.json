  "description": "The Vector class is considered legacy and should be replaced with ArrayList for better performance and modern code style. Vector is synchronized by default which adds unnecessary overhead in single-threaded scenarios.",
  "example": "Instead of: Vector<String> v = new Vector<>(); Use: ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); For thread safety, use: Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>()) or CopyOnWriteArrayList",
